## Current Status

- Docs updated to match current components (Backgrounds, Colors, Icons).
- No additional components beyond those in `Sources/SaneUI/`.

## Next Steps (Suggested)

- Expand component library only after shared usage is confirmed.
- Add tests for new components as they are introduced.
- Keep color tokens aligned with brand guidelines.
