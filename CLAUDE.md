## What is SaneUI?

SaneUI is a Swift package plus a catalog app. It is the shared source of truth
for settings chrome, About panes, license surfaces, updater rows, colors, and
button styling across the SaneApps apps that ship shared UI.

---

## Project Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Sources/SaneUI/` | Shared package code |
| `Sources/SaneUICatalog/` | Live catalog/source-of-truth app |
| `Tests/` | Unit tests |
| `Package.swift` | Swift Package manifest |

---

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Build
swift build

# Test
swift test

# Add to a typical app repo Package.swift
.package(path: "../../infra/SaneUI")
```

---

## Shared UI Rules

- Check `Sources/SaneUICatalog/SaneUICatalogApp.swift` before changing any shared settings/About/license/update surface.
- Shared settings text must stay bright white and at least `13pt`.
- Do not reintroduce gray helper text, `mailto:` bug-report links, `Manage Access` copy, or `.buttonStyle(.bordered)` in shared surfaces.
- Prefer extending existing shared views over adding app-local one-offs.

---

## Adding Components

1. Create component in `Sources/SaneUI/Components/`
2. Add SwiftUI preview
3. Document public API
4. Run `swift test`
5. Update consuming apps if needed
